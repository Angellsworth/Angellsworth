# Hey, I'm Angela 💻🪄💗  
Welcome to my little corner of the internet — where **code meets caffeine**, **haircuts meet HTML**, and hope gets written in semicolons.

## 💻 What I Do  
I’m a **MERN stack developer**, **barber**, **mother**, and a quiet force for change in tech.  
I recently completed the **Adobe Digital Academy Software Engineering Immersive** as a **full scholarship recipient**, and I’m pivoting with purpose — writing clean code and building a future that reflects who I really am.  

I support **Tech Moms**, build things with heart, and regularly battle CSS like it's a rogue Weeping Angel.

✨ I’m here to be a good example for my kids, a safe person in dev spaces, and maybe — just maybe — someone’s Mr. Darcy of debugging.

- **Back-End:** Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Django  
- **Programming Languages:** JavaScript, Python, SQL  
- **Other Cool Stuff:** Git, APIs, EJS, Handlebars  
- **Fun Fact:** I once delivered my neighbor’s baby. (No pressure, GitHub.)

## ⚡ Random Angela Lore  
💈 I spent **20+ years as a cosmetologist** before switching to tech — now I shape **code instead of bangs**.  
🧁 I love **Harry Potter (Snape forever)**, **Doctor Who**, **Lord of the Rings**, and **anything Jane Austen**.  
🌿 I’ve planted **lavender at every home** I’ve lived in. It’s how I know I’m growing.  
🍼 And yes — I once delivered a neighbor’s baby. Just a normal Tuesday, honestly.
