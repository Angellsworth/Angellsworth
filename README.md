# Hey, I'm Angela 🧙🏽‍♀️🌿✨  
Welcome to my little corner of the internet — where **code meets caffeine**, and **haircuts meet HTML** in a cloud of lavender-scented magic.

## 💻 What I Do  
I’m a **MERN stack developer**, **barber**, **mother**, and unapologetic **women-in-tech hype witch**.  
I support **Tech Moms**, build cool things, and routinely yell at my CSS like it’s a haunted mirror.

✨ I’m here for **accessible tech, soft community, and bringing more women into dev spaces** — because we’ve always belonged here.
